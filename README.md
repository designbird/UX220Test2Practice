# UX220 Sample Test 2

1. Add a phone number to the contact form that you made for assignment 4. Add twitter bootstrap to your project and format the form using twitter bootstrap form structure. [see the example here](Question1.html)

2. Add an attribute to the phone number and email labels so that you can add a css rule to give those labels a blue background. Create blue space equal to the current font size around those labels. Create more space equal to 1/2 the current font size around the labels that isn't blue but matches the page background. [see the example here](Question2.html)

3. Use jQuery to format the phone number when the form is submitted. It should be numbers only despite what the user inputs. For instance +1-519-226-1234 input by the user should be changed to 15192261234 as the form is submitted. Add properties to the other fields so that the form can't be submitted unless the fields are all filled out and the email address has an @ sign in it. [see the example here](Question3.html)
